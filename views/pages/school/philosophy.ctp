<h1><?php echo $this->pageTitle = 'Religious School Philosophy'?></h1>
<p>Religious education at Temple Beth Tikvah works in partnership with the home to foster a commitment to Judaism and Israel.  We provide the foundation for our students to pursue a lifelong study of Torah, Shabbat and festivals, symbols, ethics, traditions, and history.  A graduate of Temple Beth Tikvah expresses Jewish values in personal behavior.  Our students understand the basic meaning of the prayers and are able to participate fully in religious services.  At our school, our students observe and share life cycle â€“events with Jews and others.  Through a variety of formal and informal educational experiences, our students have the opportunity to develop a personal connection to God, a sense of the beauty of Judaism, and the expanse of Jewish thought.  By understanding Judaism and its traditions and values, our students are empowered to make informed choices as members of the Jewish community and the greater community of which we all are a part.</p>
